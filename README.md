This is a repository containing my solutions to the (https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE/)[RPISEC MBE] aka **Modern Binary Exploitation** course.

Most of those exploits work correctly, are self-contained and need no fixing or adjusting, couple of them might need so.

Finally, maybe two of them (notably *lab9A*) are not finished yet or simply not working / not yielding shell access due to some issues I didn't have patience looking to.

It was a lot of fun doing this VM.

Cheers.
